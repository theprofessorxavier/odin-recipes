    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lumpia are Filipino spring rolls, a popular and festive treat.  These crispy, deep-fried rolls consist of a thin wrapper encasing a savory filling typically made with ground pork, chopped vegetables like carrots, onions, and cabbage, and seasoned with garlic, ginger, and soy sauce.  The golden-brown, crunchy exterior gives way to a flavorful interior, often complemented by a sweet and sour dipping sauce.  A staple at Filipino celebrations and gatherings, lumpia are enjoyed as appetizers or snacks and represent a beloved and shareable comfort food.</p>
