    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a dish made with layers of lasagna noodles, meat sauce, and a creamy cheese filling. The noodles are typically cooked al dente before being layered with the other ingredients. The meat sauce is made with ground beef, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spices. The cheese filling is made with ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese. Once the lasagna is assembled, it is baked in an oven until it is bubbly and the noodles are tender. Lasagna is a popular dish for both casual and special occasions.</p>
