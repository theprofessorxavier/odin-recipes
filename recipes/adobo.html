    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Adobo is a quintessential Filipino dish and cooking method, often hailed as the unofficial national food.  It features meat (most commonly chicken or pork) marinated and stewed in a potent mixture of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and peppercorns, resulting in a tender, flavorful dish with a distinctive balance of salty, sour, and savory notes.  This versatile dish boasts numerous regional variations, with some incorporating coconut milk or sugar, and can be adapted to use other proteins like beef, seafood, or even vegetables.  Deeply rooted in Filipino culinary tradition, adobo is a comforting and beloved staple, typically served with rice to absorb its rich, tangy sauce.</p>
